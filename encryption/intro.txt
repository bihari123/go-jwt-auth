In encryption, you have a message and then you need a key to encrypt and decrypt that message.
Symmetric encryption uses a Rot13 algorithm (that rotates every alphabet of the message by 13 characters). Eg. HMAC
Assymetric key: RSA and ECDSA.
Symmetric encryption is often faster than assymetric.

TO DO :
 find out how secure communication work by start with assymetric key and then shifting to symmetric key.

## base64
  the reason we use base64 (by the way, it is not encryption) bcoz all the characters in base64 are printable.

## Encryption 
 - Symmetric 
  - AES
 - Assymetric
  - RSA
