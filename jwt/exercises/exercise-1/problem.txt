- Create a server with two end points 
 - Endpoint / should display a webpage with a register form on it
   - This should take at least a username and password
   - It should post to register 
 - Endpoint /register should save the username and password in a map
   - The password should be securely stored using bcrypt
   - redirect the user back to the endpoint "/" afterwards
