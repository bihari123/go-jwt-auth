- modify createToken and parseToken to use JWT
  - create a custom claims type that embeds jwt.StandardClaims
  - The custome claims type should have the sessionID in it
  - make sure to set the ExpiresAt field with a time limit 
  - use an HMAC signing method
  - make sure to check if the token is valid in the parseToken endpoint
